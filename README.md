## 🛠️ Current Projects

### [Facial Emotional Recognition System (FER)](https://github.com/vdhanda22/Facial-Emotional-Recognition-System--FER-)
- Developed a **machine learning-based facial emotional recognition system** capable of identifying emotions (e.g. **happiness**, **sadness**, **surprise**) from facial expressions in **real-time**.
- Led the design and implementation of a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** for **emotion classification**, achieving **85% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- Streamlined **FER processes** through targeted **hyperparameter tuning** and effective **transfer learning techniques**; achieved a **15% increase in accuracy** on emotion recognition tasks using existing datasets tailored to specific user scenarios, reduced **processing time** from **300ms** to less than **150ms** per frame.


### [Fake News Detections using GNN](https://github.com/vdhanda22/Fake-News-Detections-using-GNN)
- Developed a **GNN-based fake news detection model**, achieving **95% classification accuracy** on a benchmark dataset through advanced **graph attention mechanisms**.
- Optimized the **GNN inference pipeline** for deployment, reducing **inference latency** to <50ms per news item, making it suitable for **real-time applications**.
- Leveraged **transfer learning techniques** to fine-tune the **GNN** for **multilingual datasets**, extending the model's applicability to global **misinformation challenges**.


### [Employee Identification & Tracking System](https://github.com/vdhanda22/employee-identification-tracking-system)
- Developed an **Employee Identification & Tracking System** using **RFID sensors** and **security cameras** to track employee locations and generate **real-time reports**.
- Integrated **machine learning** and **computer vision** for **real-time location search** based on names or images, improving **accuracy** and **security**.
- Built a **web and mobile application** with **role-based user access**, **visitor registration**, and automated **reporting** for **time tracking** and **activity analysis**.


### [Social Media Post Scheduling](https://github.com/vdhanda22/Social-Media-Post-Scheduling)
- Integrated **A/B testing workflows** for **scheduling strategies**, generating actionable insights that boosted **campaign ROI** by **20%**.
- Optimized **API call management** through intelligent **caching** and **batching strategies**, reducing requests by **40%**.
- Integrated **analytics dashboards** with **real-time metrics** on post-performance, providing actionable insights to users for **content strategy improvement**.
